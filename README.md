# tic-tac-toe

Tic Tac Toe project for the Odin Project's curriculum. This was my first go at anything involving objects/OOP, AI algorithms and recursion.

Reworking the structure of the entire game to make the miniMax algorithm possible, then getting the algorithm's logic to work soundly took me two weeks. 
Needless to say, this was a fun and infuriating experience. 10/10 would not do again
